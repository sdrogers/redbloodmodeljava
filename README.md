# The Red Cell Model

This repository holds Java code for the Red Blood Cell model.


## Introduction

Behind the immense complexity, diversity and dynamic changes of living cells, there is an ancient and universal subset of basic processes that maintain cell integrity. These processes usually referred to as cellular homeostasis, control membrane potentials, osmotic equilibrium, cell volume, the intracellular milieu, and the balance between passive and active transports of water and solutes across the plasma membrane of the cells. The RCM*.jar model is a mathematical-computational representation of the dynamic processes controlling human red blood cell homeostasis in health and disease.  The Liferspan*.Jar is an extension of the RCM model dedicated to investigate the changes in red blood cell homeostasis throughout the long circulatory lifespan of the cells. Comprehensive guidance on the operation and applications of the RCM model is contained in two papers by Simon D. Rogers and Virgilio L. Lew):  “Introducing a novel multiplatform model of red blood cell homeostasis with an investigation on the mechanisms linking Ca2+-induced dehydration to changes in cell pH and colloidosmotic pressure” (bioRxiv xxx) and “Changes in the homeostasis of human red blood cells during capillary transits” (bioRxiv yyy). Corresponding information on the use of the Lifespan model is in a third paper of this series “Resolving the mechanism of the long circulatory lifespan of human red blood cells with new insights on the generation of the hyperdense collapse of irreversibly sickled cells” (bioRxiv zzz).
